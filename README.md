# Pulsar-Stellar Research

This repository contains implementations and illustrative code to accompany
DeepMind publications. Along with publishing papers to accompany research
conducted at DeepMind, we release open-source
environments,
data sets,
and code to
enable the broader research community to engage with our work and build upon it,
with the ultimate goal of accelerating scientific progress to benefit society.
For example, you can build on our implementations of the
Deep Q-Network or
Differential Neural Computer, or experiment
in the same environments we use for our research.

If you enjoy building tools, environments, software libraries, and other
infrastructure of the kind listed below, you can view open positions to work in
related areas on our \__careers page__/.
